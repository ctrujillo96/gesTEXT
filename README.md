# gesTEXT
Inspiration
Coming to WearHacks, we were inspired by the variety of hardware available for us to use. At first, we wanted to use Oculus Rift and Leap Motion together to create a virtual reality application, but learning Unity proved to be too complicated for us. We ultimately decided on focusing our attention on Leap Motion in combination with Twilio.

What it does
In a world with increasing emphasis on convenience, gesTEXT aims to send text with simple hand gestures. gesTEXT captures specific hand gestures, transcribing them into text and sending the text to a mobile device. 

How I built it
gesTEXT was coded based on open source materials written in JavaScript, HTML, and PHP. The Leap Motion Controller was used to sense specific hand gestures, and Twilio’s services were used to send text messages.

Challenges I ran into
One challenge was trying to implement JavaScript HTML, and PHP. Also, the gesture recognition of Leap Motion was too sensitive. For instance, a swipe was mistakenly identified as a circle.

Accomplishments that I’m proud of
We were proud of being able to understand the logic behind Leap Motion. Learning how to set up a local server to run our program was also a great experience. Overall, discovering different ways to complete a complicated task boosted our confidence as computer programmers. 

What I learned
In the process of creating gesTEXT, we learned how to use Twilio and setting up the server. Along the way, we also picked up a bit of JavaScript and understood how to use the data obtained by the Leap Motion Controller. 

What’s next for gesTEXT
After successfully sending a basic text message and image, gesTEXT aims to perform more advanced tasks, such as sending recorded audio.

Built With
Leap Motion, Twilio, MAMP server, JavaScript, HTML, PHP
